## Gemini Annotator

### **Project Description**:  
This project is an AI-powered object detection and visualization tool built using Streamlit and Google Gemini 2.0 API. It processes uploaded images, identifies objects using a large language model, and generates 2D bounding boxes with descriptive labels. Key features include:  
- Interactive image upload and prompt input through a user-friendly web interface.  
- AI-based object recognition with unique labeling of multiple objects.  
- Visualization of labeled bounding boxes directly on the uploaded images.  
- Real-time response generation leveraging Google Gemini's generative capabilities.  
- Integration with Python libraries like PIL for image rendering and manipulation.
